  ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!
  <br /><br />
  I'm a Computer Science grad student at The George Washington University.
  <br /><br />
  My tech journey began at Larsen & Toubro InfoTech, and it really took off at The George Washington University. I've been deep in designing, developing, debugging, deploying, and documenting some cool software solutions, fully immersing myself in the magical software lifecycle.
  <br /><br />
  As an Oracle Certified Professional JAVA 11 Developer, I have a strong proficiency in Javaâ€”the programming language, though my enthusiasm for its caffeinated namesake is strong too! In agile environments, I am dedicated to ensuring cross-platform compatibility and rapid rollout.
  <br /><br />
  Let's connect and create some tech magic together. Exploring new ideas is always brighter in dark modeâ€”after all, light attracts bugs!
  <br /><br />
  Whether it's brainstorming the next big thing or diving into the code, I'm all in!
